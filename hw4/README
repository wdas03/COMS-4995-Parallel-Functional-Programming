COMS 4995 002 Parallel Function Programming

Homework 4

Due at 11:59 PM Sunday, November 6th, 2022

Edit this file, wordFreq.hs, and wordLadder.hs, combine them in
a .zip file (no subdirectories, please), and upload it to Courseworks.
Do not rename the files.

Above, include your name, UNI, list of people with whom your spoke about the
assignment, and online references your consulted.

Write your code alone.  You many consult the instructor, TAs, and other
students, but do not copy/modify other's code.

-----

Grading: 60% correctness: first and foremost, it needs to be correct
         30% style: is it readable, functional, concise?
	 10% performance

Use lts-19.23 as the "resolver" for the Haskell Tool Stack.

Your code should compile under GHC 9.0.2 with no warnings, e.g.,

stack --resolver lts-19.23 ghc -- --make -Wall wordFreq
